					<p>
						Scrolling Animation is a script written in pure Javascript with the purpose of
						implementing easy-to-use scrolling activated animations in websites. Those can
						be used to improve the User Experience, by making the website content display
						a little more dynamic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Its implementation and usage is explained in details in this page. If you're not
						interested in how it works, and just want to quickly learn how to use it in your
						website just skip to the "How to use" section.

						To avoid using repeated long words a lot of times in this documentation, I'll list
						some of the definitions relevant to the script implementation and their abbreviations.
						If you run into an abbreviation that you're not sure the meaning of, come back here
						to find it!
					</p>
					<h3>Terminology:</h3>
					<dl>
						<dt>CO (Controlled Object)</dt>
						<dd>
							Those are the elements being controlled by the animation. Their DOM CSS properties
							will be updated according to the animation state.
						</dd>
						<dt>ABS (Animation Beginning State)</dt>
						<dd>
							This is the state of the COs before and at the animation beginning. It's an object
							containing the list of properties that are controlled by the animation.
						</dd>
						<dt>AES (Animation Ending State)</dt>
						<dd>
							This is the state of the COs at the ending and after the animation is done. It's an object
							containing the list of properties that are controlled by the animation.
						</dd>
						<dt>BTP (Beginning Triggering Point)</dt>
						<dd>
							This is the point that will trigger the beginning of the animation. It can be either
							a screen Y position in pixels or an element's ID.
						</dd>
						<dt>ETP (Ending Triggering Point)</dt>
						<dd>
							This is the point that will trigger the end of the animation. It can be either a screen
							Y position in pixels or an element's ID.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>
						Before the viewport top border reaches the BTP element or position, the animation will be in the
						"Inactive" state. In that state, the COs properties will be equal to the ABS properties.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the moment the viewport top border hits the BTP, the animation will shift to the "Active" state. The
						COs properties will be calculated according to the ratio of the current viewport position and
						the distance between the BTP and ETP. The closer the screen is to the ETP, the closer the properties
						will be to the AES, and vice-versa.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the viewport passes the ETP, the animation will shift to the "Done" state, where all the COs
						properties will be equal to the AES.
					</p>
					<p>
						To make the script a little more efficient, we store the current state of every CO in an array and
						only touch the DOM CSS properties when there is a change. This avoids the DOM CSS being manipulated
						more often than necessary and possibly causing unnecessary re-renders.
					</p>

					How to use
				</div>
				<div class="body">
					<p>
						To use Scrolling Animation, first you'll have to assign an ID to the elements that are being
						manipulated (COs) and optionally an ID to the elements that will function as BTP and ETP (if
						you want to use elements instead of absolute pixel positions):
					</p>
					<p class="code">
						&lt;div id="BTP"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
						&lt;div id="ETP"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
						&lt;div id="object"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						Then, create a new Scrolling Animation using the ID of the COs, an object containing the
						Animation Beginning State, an object containing the Animation Ending State, an object
						with the BTP and an object with the ETP as arguments. The ABS and AES objects should have
						only matching fields, and the keys should be the properties to be changed during the animation.
						While the BTP and ETP objects should have an 'id' field or a 'posY' field, depending on what
						is going to be used as triggering points.
					</p>
					<p class="code">
						&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />
						new ScrollingAnimation("object", { left: 0 }, { left: 200 }, { id: "BTP" }, { id: "ETP" });<br />
						&lt;/script&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are controlling more than one object, their IDs should be passed as an array:
					</p>
					<p class="code">
						&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />
						new ScrollingAnimation(["id1", "id2"], { left: 0 }, { left: 200 }, { id: "BTP" }, { id: "ETP" });<br />
						&lt;/script&gt;
