					<p>
						Scrolling Animation is a script written in pure Javascript with the purpose of
						implementing easy-to-use scrolling activated animations in websites. Those can
						be used to improve the User Experience, by making the website content display
						a little more dynamic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Its implementation and usage is explained in details in this page. If you're not
						interested in how it works, and just want to quickly learn how to use it in your
						website just skip to the "How to use" section.

					<p>
						To avoid using repeated long words a lot of times in this documentation, I'll list
						some of the definitions relevant to the script implementation and their abbreviations.
						If you run into an abbreviation that you're not sure the meaning of, come back here
						to find it!
					</p>
					<h3>Abbreviations:</h3>
					<dl>
						<dt>CO (Controlled Object)</dt>
						<dd>
							Those are the elements being controlled by the animation. Their DOM CSS properties
							will be updated according to the animation state.
						</dd>
						<dt>ABS (Animation Beginning State)</dt>
						<dd>
							This is the state of the COs before and at the animation beginning. It's an object
							containing the list of properties that are controlled by the animation.
						</dd>
						<dt>AES (Animation Ending State)</dt>
						<dd>
							This is the state of the COs at the ending and after the animation is done. It's an object
							containing the list of properties that are controlled by the animation.
						</dd>
						<dt>BTP (Beginning Triggering Point)</dt>
						<dd>
							This is the point that will trigger the beginning of the animation. It can be either
							a screen Y position in pixels or an element's ID.
						</dd>
						<dt id="TP4">ETP (Ending Triggering Point)</dt>
						<dd>
							This is the point that will trigger the end of the animation. It can be either a screen
							Y position in pixels or an element's ID.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>
						Before the viewport top border reaches the BTP element or position, the animation will be in the
						"Inactive" state. In that state, the COs properties will be equal to the ABS properties.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the moment the viewport top border hits the BTP, the animation will shift to the "Active" state. The
						COs properties will be calculated according to the ratio of the current viewport position and
						the distance between the BTP and ETP. The closer the screen is to the ETP, the closer the properties
						will be to the AES, and the closer the screen is to the BTP, the closer the properties will be to the
						ABS.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the viewport passes the ETP, the animation will shift to the "Done" state, where all the COs
						properties will be equal to the AES.
					</p>
					<p id="TP5">
						To make the script a little more efficient, we store the current state of every CO in an array and
						only touch the DOM CSS properties when there is a change. This avoids the DOM CSS being manipulated
						more often than necessary and possibly causing unnecessary re-renders.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div id="CO2" class="section">
				<div class="title">
					How to use
				</div>
				<div class="body">
					<p>
						To use Scrolling Animation, first you'll have to assign an ID to the elements that are being
						manipulated (COs) and optionally an ID to the elements that will function as BTP and ETP (if
						you want to use elements instead of absolute pixel positions):
					</p>
					<p class="code">
						&lt;div id="BTP"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
						&lt;div id="ETP"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
						&lt;div id="object"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						Then, create a new Scrolling Animation using the following syntax:
					</p>
					<p class="code">
						new ScrollingAnimation(CO, ABS, AES, BTP, ETP, Config);
					</p>
					<p id="TP6">
						<em>CO</em> should be either a string containing a single ID or an array containing the strings
						of all the Controlled Objects.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>ABS</em> and <em>AES</em> should be Javascript objects containing the CSS properties that
						will be controlled during the animation. Both of them should <strong>only</strong> have matching
						keys, or the script will log an error to the console and cancel the animation. In the case of
						the <em>backgroundColor</em> and <em>color</em> properties, their values should also be
						objects containing the red, green, blue and alpha values of the color. <strong>All</strong> the
						color fields must be specified, as in <em>{ red: 0, green: 23, blue: 255, alpha: 1 }</em>.
					</p>
					<p id="TP7">
						The CSS properties supported right now are:
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="CO3">top</dt>
						<dt id="CO4">bottom</dt>
						<dt id="CO5">left</dt>
						<dt id="CO6">right</dt>
						<dt id="CO7">opacity</dt>
						<dt id="CO8">backgroundColor</dt>
						<dt id="CO9">color</dt>
					</dl>
					<p>
						Or any other CSS property whose value is only a <strong>number</strong> (as the <em>opacity</em> for example).
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>BTP</em> and <em>ETP</em> should both be Javascript objects with either an <em>id</em> field
						(with the ID of the BTP/ETP element) or a <em>posY</em> field (with the BTP/ETP Y position in pixels).
						If they are not supplied, the default values of <em>id</em> and <em>posY</em> will be <em>null</em>
						and 0 respectivelly. If <em>id</em> has any value other than <em>null</em> the element with its ID
						will be used, and <em>posY</em> will represent an offset from that element. For example,
						<em>{ id: "box", posY: 100 }</em> means we will use the element with the ID "box" as a BTP/ETP, but
						only start after an offset of 100px from it. Negative offsets are also valid.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, <em>Config</em> is a Javascript object with the configuration settings for this Scrolling
						Animation instance. This is optional and can be ommited if the default configuration settings are
						desired. The configuration options supported are listed below:
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>killOnEnd</dt>
						<dd>
							If this configuration is set to <em>true</em>, the animation will kill itself once it reaches
							the "Done" state. The default value is <em>false</em>.
						</dd>
					</dl>

					<h3>Using units on position properties:</h3>
					<p>
						When using the <em>top</em>, <em>bottom</em>, <em>left</em> and <em>right</em> CSS properties, there
						are two options: Define the CSS unit to be used or use the default "px" unit.
					</p>
					<p>
						If both the ABS and AES have a unitless number, the default "px" unit is assumed.
					</p>
					<p class="code">
						new ScrollingAnimation("id", { left: 0 }, { left: 50 }, { id: "BTP" }, { id: "ETP" });<br />
						// Implicit pixels unit: ABS has left = 0px and AES has left = 50px.
					</p>
					<p>
						If either ABS or AES have a unitless number, but the other one <strong>specifies</strong>
						a unit, this unit will be used on <strong>both</strong>.
					</p>
					<p class="code">
						new ScrollingAnimation("id", { left: "0vw" }, { left: 50 }, { id: "BTP" }, { id: "ETP" });<br />
						// Explicit viewport-width unit: ABS has left = 0vw and AES has left = 50vw.
					</p>
					<p>
						If both ABS and AES have a unit, their unit is going to be used. <strong>But their units
						must match</strong>, or you'll have the unwanted behavior of having the ABS unit being used
						in the "Inactive" and "Active" states, while the AES unit is used in the "Done" state. That's
						almost certainly not what you desire.
					</p>
					<p class="code">
						new ScrollingAnimation("id", { left: "-50vw" }, { left: "50vw" }, { id: "BTP" }, { id: "ETP" });<br />
						// Explicit viewport-width unit: ABS has left = -50vw and AES has left = 50vw.
						// The units match!
					</p>
					<p>
						Remember to use quotes if you are using units, since <em>{ left: 50vw }</em> is invalid Javascript.
